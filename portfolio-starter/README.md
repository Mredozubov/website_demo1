# Portfolio Starter (Static)

A clean, single-page portfolio you can deploy free on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## Quick start
1. Edit `index.html`: put your name, links, and project details.
2. Replace images in `assets/` (use JPG/PNG). Optional: add `YourName_Resume.pdf`.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.
4. Deploy (pick one):
   - **GitHub Pages**: create a repo, push files, in repo Settings → Pages → Deploy from `main` (root). Your site will be at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.
   - **Netlify**: drag‑and‑drop the folder at https://app.netlify.com/drop or connect your repo.
   - **Vercel**: import your repo at https://vercel.com/new and deploy.

## Customize
- Colors and spacing live in `style.css`.
- Add projects by duplicating a `<article class="card">…</article>` block.
- Add pages by creating new `.html` files and linking them from the nav.

## Tips for a Hiring Manager–friendly portfolio
- Lead with 2–3 strong projects.
- Use impact metrics (e.g., “cut build time 40%”). 
- Link live demos and source.
- Keep it fast, accessible, and mobile‑friendly.
